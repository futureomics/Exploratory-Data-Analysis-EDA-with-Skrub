# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-with-Skrub
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Skrub is a powerful and modern approach to analyzing tabular data, particularly when that data is messy, incomplete, or contains categorical columns.

skrub is a Python library designed to streamline data cleaning, encoding, and integration tasks — making it especially useful in EDA workflows.

skrub is a Python library to ease preprocessing and feature engineering for tabular machine learning.
Our long-term goal is to directly connect database tables to machine learning estimators.

🔍 What is Skrub?
Skrub is an open-source Python library that helps you:

Clean and encode categorical variables

Join messy tables (fuzzy joins)

Auto-handle dirty or inconsistent string data

Integrate well with pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn pipelines

It’s maintained by the creators of Scikit-learn and is excellent for data scientists working with real-world, messy tabular data.



✅ Why Use Skrub for EDA?
📉 Automates tedious cleaning and encoding

🧠 Smart handling of dirty text and categorical columns

🔗 Can merge datasets even with fuzzy/non-exact keys

💼 Integrates well with ML pipelines (via Scikit-learn)
